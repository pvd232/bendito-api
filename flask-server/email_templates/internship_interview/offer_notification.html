          After reviewing interview results and deliberating with my team, I am
          excited to offer you the {role} internship for the summer!
        </p>

        <p>
          Our interview process was extensive, starting with 1000+ applicants
          and 50+ interviews. However, your experience and personal alignment
          with our mission stood out from the rest. We are confident you would
          be a valuable addition to our team as we seek to build a better future
          for eating disorder recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next hour I will share to a cloud-based, formal offer letter
          for you to sign. We are targeting a soft start date of
          <strong>Wednesday 6/14</strong>. On that date we will conduct
          onboarding processes. If this date doesn't work for you, or you
          <strong>have work authorization requirements</strong>, or other
          questions, please let me know as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>Congratulations!</p>

        <p>--</p>
        <p>Best,</p>
