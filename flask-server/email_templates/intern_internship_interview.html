          Our team at Chera was impressed by your qualifications, and we're
          excited to invite you to interview for the {role} internship! This
          process was very competitive, with less than 5% of candidates being
          selected for an interview.

        <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px">
          We would like to further discuss your skills and experiences. The
          interview will provide an opportunity for us to get to know you better
          and for you to learn more about our Cheraâ€™s culture and the role.
