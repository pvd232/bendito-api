<p>Welcome to Chera!</p>
<p style="margin-top: 15px">
  Thank you for everything you do to support eating disorder recovery! Weâ€™re
  thrilled to have you join our platform and humbled to have you as a partner in
  our mission to build a better future for eating disorder recovery.

<p style="margin-top: 15px">
  Dietitians such as yourself are the lifeblood of our movement to improve
  access to care by legitimizing food as medicine for eating disorders. We
  believe our platform will provide you with tools and insights to further this
  goal. Together, by building a compelling dataset of improved clinical outcomes
  and reduced recovery times, we hope to unlock insurance coverage for our
  service and change the way eating disorders are treated. We look forward to
  working with you to make this vision a reality.
